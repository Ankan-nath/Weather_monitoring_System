# Weather_monitoring_System
It is an IoT based project where various sensors are connected to get data and observe it through a web page using local network connection or local server.
We have used NodeMcu development board which consist of the microcontroller ESP8266 as it consist of inbuilt wifi and bluetooth module.
We can code it in the same IDE as the arduino but make sure to install the esp8266 drivers and its corresponding packages.
We have used the Wifi to connect it to internet and HTTPs as its protiocal.
Sensors that are used are temperature sensor(DHT11), Dht11 for humidity as well, LDR module for light sensing and Rain sensor for intensity of rain you can also add a pressure sensor as well. 
The arduino code is uploaded and another ppt describing its sensors and all its working is given.
It is an group project and the members are: Sreerupa Sengupta, Sidhant and Sayantan paul.
